/**
 * The composer's text for [conversation], a private peer or null for the public
 * chat.
 *
 * Saveable, so unsent text outlives chat leaving composition: a destination
 * pushed over chat replaces it rather than covering it. Changing conversation
 * loads that conversation's [storedDraft] instead.
 *
 * The saved text is filed under the conversation it was typed into, because a
 * restore does not check inputs. The selected peer is not saved and comes back
 * null after process death, so without the key a private draft would reappear
 * in the public composer, one tap from being sent to everyone.
